## Split Landing Page
- A responsive landing page that showcases two popular gaming consoles: PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X.
- The page is split into two halves, each representing one of the consoles, with interactive hover effects that highlight each section when hovered over.

## Features

- Interactive Split View: The page is divided into two sections, one for PlayStation 5 and one for Xbox Series X, each with its own background image and hover effect.
- Responsive Design: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, with optimized styles for mobile devices.
- Smooth Hover Transitions: Hovering over one section expands it, while the other section shrinks.
- Call to Action: Each section has a prominent "Buy Now" button that changes color when hovered.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: The structure of the landing page.
- CSS: Styling and animations for a smooth user experience.
- JavaScript: To handle the hover interactions between the two sections.

## Customization

- Images: Replace the ps5.jpg and xbox-series-x.jpg images with your own images.
- Color Scheme: The colors are defined using CSS variables (e.g., --left-bg-color and --right-bg-color). Feel free to modify these to suit your theme.
- Button Style: Customize the button's appearance by modifying the .btn class in the style.css file.
