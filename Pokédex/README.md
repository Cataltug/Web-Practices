# Pokémon Pokedex with PvP Battle System
- This project is an enhanced version of a Pokémon Pokedex web app, originally built following a YouTube tutorial of https://github.com/Berkantcen.
- I added several custom features to improve functionality and make the app more interactive. Here are the key updates:

## Features
### 1️⃣ Advanced Search & Filtering
- Type-based Filtering: Users can filter Pokémon by their type (e.g., only Fire Type Pokémon).
- Enhanced Search: Users can search Pokémon by name, ID, or type to quickly find their desired Pokémon.

### 2️⃣ PvP Battle System (Mini Game)
- Users can select two Pokémon and battle based on their stats.
- The winner is determined by a comparison of the Pokémon's attack power and type advantages/weaknesses.

### 3️⃣ Pokémon Stats
- Each Pokémon displays important stats such as Attack Rate and HP.
- The stats are used in the PvP battle system to determine the outcome.

### 4️⃣ Favorites Feature (Coming Soon)
- I plan to implement a feature that allows users to add Pokémon to their favorites list.
- This will be saved using localStorage for persistence, so users can access their favorite Pokémon even after refreshing the page.

## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Fetch API to retrieve data from the Pokémon API: https://pokeapi.co/

### How to Use
- Clone this repository to your local machine:
- git clone https://github.com/Cataltug/EnhancedPokedex.git
- Open the app in your browser.
- Search and filter Pokémon using the input box and dropdown menu.
- Select two Pokémon and click on "Start Battle" to initiate the PvP battle.


## Future Improvements

### Pokémon Weakness/Strength Visualization
- Plan to visually display Pokémon's type advantages and weaknesses.

### Pokémon Abilities and Moves
- Pokémon will have unique abilities that can impact battles. For example, abilities like "Intimidate" can lower the opponent's attack power.
- Additionally, each Pokémon will have a set of special moves, adding more depth to the battle system.

### Additional Pokémon Information
- Plan to add more detailed information about Pokémon, including:
- Habitat: The environments in which each Pokémon lives.
- Height and Weight: Stats related to the physical size of Pokémon.
- Backstory: History and lore behind each Pokémon.
- Rarity Levels: Indicating how rare or difficult to find a Pokémon is.
